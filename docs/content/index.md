# What is OpenVNet?

OpenVNet is what you would call a network hypervisor or [software-defined networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking). It is basically is to networking what virtual machines are to servers. Network engineers become able to create any network topology that they have in mind, without changing the hardware that's in place. Visit the [OpenVNet concept](concept) page to learn more.

OpenVNet is free open source software. The source is [freely available on Github](https://github.com/axsh/openvnet). Everybody is welcome to contribute to development and the software can be freely distributed. (Within the rules of the LGPL license)

# Getting started

[Installation Guide](installation.md)

This guide will teach you how to set up a basic OpenVNet environment with two VMs on the same host connected to [Open vSwitch](http://openvswitch.org). It is a great entry point into the world of OpenVNet.

We hope to get more expansive guides up in the future. Until then we encourage you to play around and contact us for assistance if needed.
